# QuizWizz

## Data model
The quiz revolves around flash-cards. Each flash card has a `question` and an `answer`
```javascript
const card = {
  question: 'Who was the first president of the United States of America?',
  answer: 'George Washington'
}
```

## TODO
- [Splash screen](https://github.com/crazycodeboy/react-native-splash-screen)
- Handle list view if no cards
