A ReactNative flashcard application

This project was carried out to familiarize myself with React Native.
I have sharpened my skills in the following areas:

- React Native ecosystem (using the API and modules)
- React Native testing and deployment
- React Ex-Navigation
- AsyncStorage
- React Native Animatable

## Background
I love to learn new weird facts from time to time. I wanted to have a fun and easy way to keep track of all the facts, so I decided to use flash cards.

The app was to be used while hiking the Pacific Crest Trail - how awesome wouldn't it be to go through some fun facts every night in my sleeping bag! ðŸš€
The application had to work offline and be as simple as possible.

## Improvements
- Add a [splash screen](https://github.com/crazycodeboy/react-native-splash-screen)
- Implement Redux
- Store flashcards in DynamoDB
- Implement a user settings page
